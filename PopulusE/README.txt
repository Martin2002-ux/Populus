It also contains an integrated help system discussing each of the models. Please go to http://www.cbs.umn.edu/populus/ for more information about Populus.

Version History
5.5 October 2012
Major work on installer, works on all platform with JAR distribution.
Minor fixes to existing models.

5.4 November 2005


5.3 September 2003
This major update includes six new modules, including stage-structured population growth, macroparasitic infection dynamics, the evolution of disease virulence, the population biology of bacterial plasmids, the evolution of temperate phage, and insect resistance management.  In addition, there are major modifications to the module on age-structured population growth, which now includes graphical inputs via a life-cycle diagram, allowing demographic projections to be initiated in multiple formats, and interchanged between them.
Along with these content additions, we have reconfigured the Populus help system for access via Adobe Acrobat Reader.  This improves graphics and equation formatting, and makes it much easier for Populus users to print help-screen pages.
Populus 5.3 also fixes a few display issues.
Populus 5.3 is provided in two languages; select Populus53Installer.zip for the English-language edition, and Populus53InstallerEsp.zip for an edition with Spanish-language help screens for those models where a translation has been completed.

5.2.1 March 2003
Fixed some minor bugs

5.2 February 2003
For this version, we have finally included all of the models from the 3.42 Dos version that we feel are still relevant including Selection, Quantitative-Genetic, Differentiation, and Coevolution models. This brings the total to 42, all with help files. Version 5.2 also includes a large number of improvements and bug fixes too numerous to detail. The other major new component to this version is the inclusion of Spanish translations for several of the help files.

5.1 August 2001
