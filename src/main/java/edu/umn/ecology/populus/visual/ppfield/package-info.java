/**
 * PopulusParameterField, similar to a Spinner.
 * <p>
 * This was originally created when Java offered no equivalent.
 * If we switch to JavaFX, this should be a javafx.scene.control.Spinner.
 * <p>
 * Many files, such as the *.gif and *.jbx, are for use in development only for visual editing.
