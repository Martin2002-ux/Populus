/**
 * Base infrastructure for Model input screens.
 * <p>
 * This only includes basic architecture for things like creation and global events.
 * Most models have some sort of "show a graph" output, which is found in edu.umn.ecology.populus.plot.
 * Code that is specific to a model should go under a subdirectory of edu.umn.ecology.populus.model.
 * <p>
 * Note that "edwin" is short for "editor window" dating back to the DOS version.
